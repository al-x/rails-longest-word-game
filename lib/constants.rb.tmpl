# Purpose: define API_KEY constant
#
# Rationale:
# Separate API key from checked-in code, but include it via 'require_relative'
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy the template file constants.rb.tmpl to constants.rb
# 2. Create a new API key. The format must be a UUID.
# 3. To avoid sharing a valid the API key via git, .gitignore should list constants.rb
#
# Caveat:
# Remember that a ruby constant must be declared with its name in
# ALL_CAPS, otherwise no magic ruby dust is sprinkled upon it and it
# will not be exported to the code which calls 'require_relative'
#
# The example key has been revoked

API_KEY = 'f9d7c6e3-ddae-4dd5-8e96-8f4a7082195f'
